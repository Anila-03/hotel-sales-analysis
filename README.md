# Hotel Sales Analysis Using Excel:

**Project Overview:** 

 This project analyzes sales trends, peak hours, and profitability for Narasimha Tiffin Centre, a small hotel business. Using Excel and Power Query, I transformed raw sales data into actionable insights, helping optimize inventory, staffing, and menu pricing.

## Project Objectives:
 
 **1️.** [Identify Sales Trends & Peak Hours](https://github.com/Anila-03/hotel-sales-analysis/blob/main/Hotel%20sales%20tremds.pdf) – Understand high-traffic periods to optimize staffing and operations.
 
**2️.** [Analyze Best & Worst Selling Items](https://github.com/Anila-03/hotel-sales-analysis/blob/main/Hotel%20Top%20and%20low%20selling%20items.pdf) – Determine which menu items drive revenue and which need marketing adjustments.

**3️.** [Evaluate Profit Margins](https://github.com/Anila-03/hotel-sales-analysis/blob/main/Hotel%20Profit%20Margin%25.pdf) – Identify high and low-profit days to optimize pricing and cost efficiency.

**4.** [Find the Busiest Days of the month](https://github.com/Anila-03/hotel-sales-analysis/blob/main/Hotel%20buiest%20days.pdf) - Identify the busiest days.

**4.** Improve Inventory Management – Use data to predict demand and prevent shortages or excess waste.

**5️.** Suggest Business Growth Strategies – Provide recommendations like promotions, menu adjustments, and operational improvements.

## Key Insights & Findings:
- **Peak Sales Days:** Jan 5, 9, 20, and 28 had the highest sales (~400+ plates, ₹6,200 revenue).
- **Slowest Sales Day:**  Jan 23 had the lowest revenue (₹4,645). Possible reasons? Weather, customer trends?
- **Top-Selling Items:** Tea & Coffee (8,186 cups),  Puri (796 plates), Idli (731.5 plates).
- **Dosa's Surprise Decline:** With only 320 plates sold, dosa sales were unexpectedly low!
- **Profit Margin Analysis:**

   **1.** **Highest Profit Day:** Jan 22 (3.3% margin, ₹5,787 profit).
  
   **2.** **Lowest Profit Day:** Jan 1 barely broke even (0.0% margin).

These insights helped optimize stock levels, introduce offers for slow days, and adjust staffing based on demand.

## Tools & Technologies Used:
- **Microsoft Excel:** Data cleaning, formuals, pivot tables.
- **Power Query:** Data transformation & automation.
- **Data Visualization:** Charts for trend analysis.

## Next Steps & Improvements:
- Create an interactive Power BI dashboard for deeper insights.
- Expand analysis using Python/R for predictive sales trends.
- Develop an inventory forecasting model to reduce waste.
